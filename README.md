# web_project_1
This web page was created to address the different learning techniques used by different people to get the same end result, retaining the information. Each block on the page gives different techniques by different people to be able to retain information you're given, and learn to apply it. Retaining information can be incredibly difficult for some, but easy for others. This is why people all over, have come up with techniques that can help individuals not only retain the information given to them but use it correctly in their daily lives, at school and at thier jobs. 
The web page uses pictures and animations to catch the readers attention to want to read and learn more. The page layouts differ with colors and images applied to keep from being too bland. Some pages also have interactive links to be able to click to learn more or go to social sites.
