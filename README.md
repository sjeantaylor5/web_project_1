# web_project_1

This web page was created to address the different learning techniques used by different people to get the same end result, retaining the information given. Each block on the page gives different techniques by different people to be able to retain information, and learning to apply it. Retaining information can be incredibly difficult for some, but easy for others. This is why people all over, have come up with techniques that can help individuals not only retain the information given to them, but use it correctly in their daily lives, at school and at their jobs.

The web page uses videos, pictures and animations to catch the readers attention to draw them in and want to learn more. TED talk videos are used to let experts use their scientific research to help those in need of finding a learning technique that works for them. From videos to writen facts to book recommendations, there are different styles for all types of people, from visual learners to bookworms, viewing this webpage. The block layouts differ with colors and images applied to keep the page from being too "bland". Some of the blocks within the page also have interactive links to be able to click to learn more or go to social sites. 

#### Plans for finalizing web_project_1:

1. Make any corrections that the reviewers see fit to enhance the webpage.
2. If possible change fonts and animations to make the webpage more appealing to the viewer.
3. Change any clickable link from a "deadlink" to a link that opens another webpage (other than the clickable links that are already open links from the brief).
